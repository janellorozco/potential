        <h2> Get To Know Me </h2>
        <p>I am passionate about entrepreneurship, technology, equality, leadership and community involvement. I graduated with an AA in Liberal Arts and a Communication certificate in May 2016. I am attending University of California, Berkeley to obtain my bachelorâ€™s in Sociology and Media Studies with an emphasis in entrepreneurship and technology.

I hope to use my leadership and program/project management skills to initiate change within my community and workplace. I plan to work for a tech company to help bridge the gap between human interaction and technology. I also hope to change the way that Human Resources works through creating a company culture that highly benefits their employees.

In the long run, I plan to get my MBA and open a business that uses multi-disciplinary teams and technology to create solutions to various social and technical issues.</p>
